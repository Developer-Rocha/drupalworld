Feature: Everything functionally related to Drupal Sitemap tests.
  [As an] Administrator
  [I want to] publish a sitemap
  [So that] search engines know about the pages in my site and improve traffic from them

#  @api @wip
#  Scenario: [Administrator] core-cron
#    Given I am logged in as a user with the administrator role
#    When I run cron
#
#  @wip
#  Scenario: [Anonymous] can check the sitemap
#    Given I am an anonymous user
#    When I go to "/sitemap.xml"
#    Then I should get a 200 HTTP response
#    And the response should not contain "Page not found"
