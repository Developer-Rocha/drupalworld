so they can be configured on the link field

## Icon field Settings type

We provide an icon field settings type for ui patterns settings

# 1.x to 2.x

## Hero block

The custom hero block was removed in favor of the existing ctools block.
If your project is using the hero block, before upgrading to a 2.x release
you will need to replace it with a ctools block for 'Entity view (content)'
and select the hero view mode.

You can now configure the hero view mode to use the hero pattern.

## Components

Components module is removed. So first uninstall the components module before
upgrading to 2.x

## UI Patterns field formatters

The module UI patterns field formatters is updated from 1.x to 2.x
There is an update path within the module, but please check that everything is
correct after updating.
